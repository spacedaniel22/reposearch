# Reposearch

This little web app fetches and displays repositories from github using the `Github API`. Also, it shows a repositories issue list in a different UI page by selecting the `Check out {{n}} open issues` button. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
